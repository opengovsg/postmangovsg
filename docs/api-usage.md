# Using the API

Currently, use of the API is limited to non-password protected campaigns only.

## Getting Started

The swagger docs are available at [https://api.postman.gov.sg/docs/](https://api.postman.gov.sg/docs/).
Using the console, **create an authorization token**. This token will be passed to all the following network requests. The examples below will create and send an Email campaign.
Try the other endpoints listed in the swagger docs to save credentials, create other types of campaigns, preview the campaign, stop and resume campaign.

### 1. Create a campaign

In order to create an email campaign, make the following API call. For SMS and Telegram campaigns, replace `type` with `SMS` or `TELEGRAM` respectively.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.postman.gov.sg/v1/campaigns' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_api_key' \
--data-raw '{
	"name": "name-of-email-project",
	"type": "EMAIL"
}'
```

**Sample response**

```json
{
  "id": 100,
  "name": "name-of-email-project",
  "created_at": "2020-11-18T09:00:00.000Z",
  "type": "EMAIL",
  "protect": false,
  "demo_message_limit": null
}
```

Take note of the returned campaign ID (100) in the response as you will need it for the rest of the steps.

### 2. Add a message template to the campaign

#### 2.1 Email campaign

In addition to the message body, you will also need to provide a `subject` and an optional `reply_to` address for email campaign templates.

```bash
curl --location --request PUT 'https://api.postman.gov.sg/v1/campaign/100/template' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_api_key' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
	"body": "Dear {{name}}, this is the content of my template.",
	"subject": "My template subject for {{name}}",
	"reply_to": "youremail@gmail.com"
}'
```

#### 2.2 SMS or Telegram campaign

Only the message body is required for SMS or Telegram campaign templates.

```bash
curl --location --request PUT 'https://api.postman.gov.sg/v1/campaign/100/template' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_api_key' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
	"body": "Dear {{name}}, this is the content of my template.",
}'
```

### 3. Upload campaign recipients

#### 3.1. Get a presigned url that will let you upload your file of recipients to S3

You will need to include a base64 encoded MD5 checksum for the file that you are uploading when retrieving the presigned URL. This can be obtained from the command line by running the following:

```bash
$ cat /Users/owner/postman-sample.csv | openssl dgst -md5 -binary | base64
thisisanexamplemd5checksum
```

This MD5 checksum should then be included as part of parameters in the following GET request.

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.postman.gov.sg/v1/campaign/100/upload/start?mime_type=text/csv&md5=thisisanexamplemd5checksum' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_api_key'
```

**Sample response**

```
{
    "presigned_url": "https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/file-staging.postman.gov.sg/some_other_parameters",
    "transaction_id": "some_transaction_id"
}
```

#### 3.2. Upload the file to the presigned url that was returned in step 3.1

```bash
curl -i --location --request PUT 'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/file-staging.postman.gov.sg/some_other_parameters' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/csv' \
--header 'Content-MD5: thisisanexamplemd5checksum' \
--data-binary '@/Users/owner/postman-sample.csv'
```

**Sample response headers**

Take note of the value of the `ETag` header in the response. You will need to use it in the next step.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
ETag: "thisisanetagvalue"
...
```

#### 3.3. After the file has been uploaded to S3, complete this process by requesting the backend to validate your file.

The values for `transaction_id` and `etag` were obtained from Step 3.1 and Step 3.2 respectively.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.postman.gov.sg/v1/campaign/100/upload/complete' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_api_key' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "transaction_id": "some_transaction_id",
    "filename": "postman-sample.csv",
    "etag": "thisisanetagvalue"
}'
```

#### 3.4 Check processing status of uploaded file

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.postman.gov.sg/v1/campaign/100/upload/status' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_api_key'
```

While the csv is being processed, `is_csv_processing` would be `true`. When `is_csv_processing` is`false`, this indicates that the csv processing is complete or an error has occurred. You can poll the `/upload/status` endpoint to refresh the file processing status.

**Sample response**

```json
{
  "is_csv_processing": true,
  "temp_csv_filename": "postman-sample.csv"
}
```

On successful file upload, `csv_filename` will reflect the uploaded file name. You can now proceed to the next step to validate your credentials.

**Sample response of successful file upload**

```json
{
  "csv_filename": "postman-sample.csv",
  "is_csv_processing": false,
  "num_recipients": 10,
  "preview": {
    "body": "Dear abc, this is the content of my template.",
    "subject": "My template subject for abc",
    "reply_to": "youremail@gmail.com"
  }
}
```

However if the file upload fails, `csv_error` will reflect the error message and you would need to repeat steps 3.1 - 3.4 again with a correct file. For example, the follwing response is returned if you uploaded an empty file.

**Sample response of failed file upload**

```json
{
  "csv_error": "Error: No rows were found in the uploaded recipient file. Please make sure you uploaded the correct file before sending.",
  "is_csv_processing": false,
  "num_recipients": 0,
  "temp_csv_filename": "postman-sample.csv"
}
```

### 4. Validate and assign campaign credentials

#### 4.1 Email campaigns

You do not need to provide any credentials for email campaigns. Make the following API call to send a test email and assign
Postman's default email credentials to your campaign.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.postman.gov.sg/v1/campaign/100/credentials' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_api_key' \
--data-raw '{
	"recipient": "youremail@gmail.com"
}'
```

#### 4.2 SMS campaigns

You will need to provide your own Twilio credentials to send a SMS campaign. For detailed instructions on how to retrieve or create these credentials
from your Twilio account, visit our [guide](https://guide.postman.gov.sg/quick-start/sms#find-twilio-credentials-on-twilio-console).

You may use either saved Twilio credentials or provide them during campaign creation. A test SMS will be sent to the phone number listed in the `recipient`
field in both options to validate the provided credentials.

**Using saved Twilio credentials**

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.postman.gov.sg/v1/campaign/100/credentials' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_api_key' \
--data-raw '{
	"label":"saved_credentials_label",
	"recipient":"+6588888888"
}'
```

**Providing Twilio credentials during campaign creation**

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.postman.gov.sg/v1/campaign/100/new-credentials/v2' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_api_key' \
--data-raw '{
	"twilio_account_sid": "ACxxx",
	"twilio_api_key": "SKxxx",
	"twilio_api_secret": "secret",
	"twilio_messaging_service_sid": "MGxxx",
	"recipient":"+6588888888"
}'
```

#### 4.3 Telegram campaigns

You will need to provide your Telegram bot token to send a Telegram campaign. For detailed instructions on how to create a Telegram bot and generate a
bot token, visit our [guide](https://guide.postman.gov.sg/quick-start/telegram-bot#create-a-telegram-bot-in-telegram).

You may use either a saved bot token or provide one during campaign creation.

**Using saved bot token**

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.postman.gov.sg/v1/campaign/100/credentials' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_api_key' \
--data-raw '{
    "label": "saved_bot_token_label"
}'
```

**Providing bot token during campaign creation**

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.postman.gov.sg/v1/campaign/100/new-credentials/v2' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_api_key' \
--data-raw '{
   "telegram_bot_token":"123123123123:xxxxxx"
}'
```

### 5. When you're ready to send the messages to everyone in the csv file you've uploaded, make a send request.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.postman.gov.sg/v1/campaign/100/send' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_api_key' \
--data-raw '{
	"rate": 10
}'
```
