## Worker

Worker configuration is a subset of [backend configuration](./backend.md), with a few worker-specific variables. 

Setting `NODE_ENV=development` or `NODE_ENV=staging` will override some defaults. If `NODE_ENV` is unset,
default `production` configuration is used.

These defaults can be modified as you wish or overridden with environment variables.

Sensitive configuration has to be set with environment variables. 

### Minimal set of environment variables

|Name|Description|
|--|--|
|`DB_URI`| URI to the postgres database |
|`SECRET_MANAGER_SALT`| Secret used to generate names of credentials to be stored in AWS Secrets Manager|
|`ECS_SERVICE_NAME`| **Worker-specific**: ECS service name used for finding the existing running tasks |

### Number of senders and loggers

In a production environment, only 1 worker of 1 variant can be set, that is, the ECS task can have **either** `MESSAGE_WORKER_SENDER=1` or `MESSAGE_WORKER_LOGGER=1` set. This is not enforced in development.

|Name|Description|
|--|--|
|`MESSAGE_WORKER_SENDER`| **Worker-specific**: Number of sender workers. Defaults to 0 |
|`MESSAGE_WORKER_LOGGER`| **Worker-specific**: Number of logger workers. Defaults to 0 |

#### Database
|Name|Description|
|--|--|
|`DB_URI`| URI to the postgres database |
|`SEQUELIZE_POOL_MAX_CONNECTIONS`|Maximum number of connection in pool  |
|`SEQUELIZE_POOL_MIN_CONNECTIONS`|Minimum number of connection in pool |
|`SEQUELIZE_POOL_ACQUIRE_IN_MILLISECONDS`|The maximum time, in milliseconds, that pool will try to get connection before throwing error|

#### AWS Settings
|Name|Description|
|--|--|
|`AWS_REGION`|Region for the S3 bucket that is used to store file uploads|

For testing locally, you may need to configure your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to be able to call AWS APIs. In production, your server should be granted the IAM role with permissions to access resources directly.

|`SES_FROM`|The email address that appears in the From field of an email|


#### Sending smses
This set of twilio credentials is used for testing locally only (ie, `NODE_ENV=development`). When in production, users will have to upload their credentials, which will be stored and retrieved from Secrets Manager.
