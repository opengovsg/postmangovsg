## Programmatic APIs

## Campaign APIs

Our Campaign APIs are meant to support our users who access us via the frontend on Postman.gov.sg and are not designed to be accessed programmatically. You may find their endpoints in our [Swagger Docs](https://api.postman.gov.sg/docs/) and they might be modified without prior notice. As such, we recommend that you <mark style="background-color:yellow;">speak with us</mark> regarding your use case and use these APIs at your own risk.

_If you have additional enquiries or potential use cases using the Campaigns API, please_ [_contact us_](https://go.gov.sg/postman-contact-us)_._&#x20;
