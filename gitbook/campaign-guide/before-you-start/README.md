# ‚òù Before You Start

## Create a common email

Although you can login with your primary email account, we recommend one email account per agency as Postman does not manage users for an agency.&#x20;

Twilio credentials will be tied to an agency email account. You might have to contact your IT administrator to create a common email account that allows multiple subscribers. The primary advantage of such a set-up is that past campaigns can be seen under one account for audit purposes.

If you think having multiple collaborators on a campaign is important, let us know in [here](https://go.gov.sg/postman-featurerequest)!

## Can I have multiple users from the same agency sharing the same account?

Sharing is caring! All users from the same agency should share one account. The rationale behind our set-up is that communications out to the public should be vetted before you press send. Each agency has its own communication guidelines & policy.

We leave it up to each agency to govern its usage of Postman. If you are sending a message broadcast to the entire country, please make sure your use case has been vetted by the [Ministry of Communications and Information](https://www.mci.gov.sg/).

## Sign in

Similar to FormSG and Go.gov.sg, **no registration is required to use PostmanSG**.

## Start creating your first campaign

PostmanSG is a multi-channel messaging service that allows you to send messages through 3 channels:

* [Email](../quick-start/email/)
* [SMS](../quick-start/sms/)
* [Telegram](../quick-start/telegram-bot/)

However, do note that each channel has its own setup so do navigate to the specific section to find out more.&#x20;

* Try out the different channel using our [Demo mode](demo-mode.md).
* Jump straight to creating your first campaign [here](../quick-start/).
