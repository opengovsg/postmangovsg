{% hint style="info" %}
You can use [GoGovSG](https://go.gov.sg/#/) or [ForEduSG](https://for.edu.sg/#/) or [ForSG](https://for.sg/#/) (this depends on your agency - see point 7 above) to upload your image file and add it to the content of your email using the image icon. Remember to copy the [https://file.go.gov.sg/\[image name\] ](https://go.gov.sg)/ [https://file.for.sg/\[image name\] ](https://for.sg/#/)link and not the https://go.gov.sg/\[image name] / https://for.sg/\[image name] link.

## Embedding an Image in Email

You can use [GoGovSG](https://go.gov.sg/#/) (for all public service officers except for those from healthcare institutions and schools) or [ForEduSG](https://for.edu.sg/#/) (for officers from schools) or [ForSG](https://for.sg/#/) (for officers from healthcare institutions) to embed an image in Postman's template.

Go to [GoGovSG](https://go.gov.sg/#/) or [ForEduSG](https://for.edu.sg/#/) or [ForSG](https://for.sg/#/) and log in using your official institution email address. Select `create new link` from file and upload your image.

Copy the shortened link into a new browser window. Copy the `file.go.gov.sg` link or `file.for.edu.sg` or`file.for.sg` into your Postman template by using the html tag shown below. The link that you paste into your Postman template should begin with _https://_...

Then, in your campaign template, click on the image icon and paste your `file.go.gov.sg` link or `file.for.edu.sg` or`file.for.sg` link into the "Source" field, then click "insert". Your image will then appear in the template box, and you can resize it by 50%, 75% or 100%.
