# Onboard onto Twilio

Want an overview? Read the [basics](rationale-for-choosing-twilio.md) page before you proceed.

## Step 1: Register your SenderID with SGNIC.

From 31 January 2023, IMDA has mandated that every organisation will have to register their senderIDs with SGNIC. This is part of anti-scam efforts to filter legitimate SMSes for recipients. To get maximum chances of getting the SenderID you want for your organisation, we encourage to complete the registration as soon as possible. You can read more about this new policy [here](https://www.imda.gov.sg/Content-and-News/Press-Releases-and-Speeches/Press-Releases/2022/Full-SMS-Sender-ID-Registration-to-be-required-by-January-2023).

Register your SenderID(s) via the [SSIR portal](https://smsregistry.sg/web/login). Approval will take a few days. More information on the registry [here](https://www.sgnic.sg/smsregistry/overview).

Once your senderIDs have been approved, proceed to step 2.

## Step 2: Fill in our Postman SMS onboarding form.

Fill in the form [here](https://form.gov.sg/#!/63c8e185f2bd6c0012c02566). The information in this form will help us provision an account for your agency in our Twilio console. Do note that at this point, you will need to submit proof of your SenderID approval by SGNIC, on the form. 2 screenshots are required - samples below.

## Step 3: Receive your confirmation email from the Postman Team.

If everything is in order, we will provision an account for you, and send you an email confirmation that your request to set up a Twilio account has been approved.

## Step 4: Receive an invitation from Twilio to join the agency account provisioned for you.

Your account name will be assigned by the Postman team for identification. It will not affect your SMS sending, nor will it be reflected in your SenderID.

## Step 5: Create your Twilio account.

## Step 6: Upgrade your account and add your credit card details.

Important information:

**Information about Twilio Billing**

Twilio works like a prepaid phone card. You will need to top up the credits in your account to start sending SMSes. We recommend using your **corporate credit card** for this.

The alternative is through direct invoicing, which is only available as an option if you send more than 19,000 SMSes a month. If the latter is your preferred option, please contact us so we can put you in touch with our Twilio account manager.

_Note: if you do not upgrade your account, you will not be able to send SMSes with your registered alphanumeric SenderID._
{% endhint %}

### To set up your billing options, go to Billing > Manage Billing > Upgrade.

Then, fill in the request billing account information.
