# Send Rate

If you are sending a large volume of SMSes in a single instance (e.g. >10000 SMSes in 1 sitting), and you require these SMSes to be sent out quickly before your next batch, contact us [here](https://form.gov.sg/#!/62b19812ff209e00126f2c47). We will link you up with our Twilio contact, where you can begin a conversation to agree on a suitable send rate.

Once that is agreed on, you should input your send rate in your Postman campaign set-up in step 4.
