You can click into your campaign to see the breakdown of the summary stats.

You can also download the campaign delivery report, which gives you a more detailed view on the status of each recipient number.

## Types of Status for SMS

SMS campaigns would generate two types of status:

{% hint style="info" %}
1. **SENT**: Your SMS was successfully delivered to the recipient.
2. **ERROR**: The mobile number was not valid. See error code descriptions for more details.
{% endhint %}

Unlike emails, you generally would not have any **INVALID** status. To see the entire list of SMS errors, you need to click on the `Export` button on the campaign landing page.
