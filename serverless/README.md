## Unsubscribe Email Digest
`unsubscribe-email-digest` consolidates unsubscribed recipients for campaigns for each user. This lambda can be scheduled to run at weekly schedule in Cloudwatch Events.

### Overview
The `unsubscribers` table stores unsubscribed recipients by `campaign_id` and `sent_at` time which indicates if the recipient has already been included in an unsubscribe digest. 

`unsubscribe-email-digest` retrieves all unsubscribed recipients and consolidated them by campaign for each user. Every user with unsubscribed recipients are sent an email with this digest. The `unsubscribers` table is updated to reflect the email digest `sent_at` time.
