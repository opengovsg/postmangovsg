      This is a gentle reminder that our post-campaign report will only be available for download for
      <b>${RETENTION_PERIOD} consecutive days</b> after you have sent out a campaign. This is an added
      security measure to prevent access to the entire contact list used in the campaign.

      <b>Best Practices</b><br>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Check your campaign statistics 1 day after you have sent out your campaign as some campaign errors
          and status updates take time to finalise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Download a copy of the post-campaign report and store it locally if you need it as a sent receipt
          for specific recipients.
