    Greetings from the Postman team,<br><br>
    In order to comply with Singapore's Spam Control Act and align with
    international bulk email practices, Postman has implemented an option
    for the recipient to unsubscribe to future emails. Campaign owners will
    receive a weekly list of people who have indicated their wish to unsubscribe
    from your emails. Please exercise your best judgment to determine whether
    or not to remove these recipients from your mailing list based on the content
    of your email. If your email is promotional in nature, please remove these
    recipients from your mailing list to respect their wishes.<br><br>
